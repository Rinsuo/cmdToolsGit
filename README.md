### Rinsuo's command line tool pack v0.6
###### (Backup of my command line tool folder)
##### Basically just a bunch of premade commands for command line tools.

### tools used:
exiftool: https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool  
ffmpeg: https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg  
yt-dlp: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp

### docs if you wanna mess around with the commands:
exiftool: https://exiftool.org/exiftool_pod.html  
ffmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html  
yt-dlp: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#usage-and-options  

### if you're not me reading this, here's what some files do:
**exiftool(drop files to cmd files):**  
.exiftool(-k) - shows exif data when you drop into it  
.forcedExtensionChange - changes file extension when windows refuses (needed it when I renamed a file to .lnk)  
.wipeExif - wipes exif data

**ffmpeg(drop files to cmd files):**  
read the file names you'll figure it out

**yt-dlp(click cmd files):**  
blob.cmd & m3u8.cmd - for downloading m3u8 videos.  
Check(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42901942)(headers screen displays info needed for the options)  
both files are for the same purpose but blob.cmd has way more options that are rarely needed.

other files just read the file names
on some of them you can put a playlist to download all videos in it
