ffmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html
yt-dlp: https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#usage-and-options


###if you're not me reading this, here's what some files do:

####exiftool(drop files to cmd)
.exiftool(-k) - shows exif data when you drop into it
.forcedExtensionChange - changes file extension when windows refuses (needed it when I renamed a file to .lnk)
.wipeExif - wipes exif data

####ffmpeg(drop files to cmd):
read the file names you'll figure it out

####yt-dlp(click cmd files):
read the file names you'll figure it out
on some of them you can put a playlist to download all videos in it
